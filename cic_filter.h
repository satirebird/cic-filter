/**
 * CIC Filter implementation.
 *
 * Some words about "Register growth"
 *
 * Depending an the filter parameters the CIC filter has a unity gain. For
 * decimation filters the gain is Gmax = (RM)^N. For interpolation filters
 * the gain on the last stage is Gmax = (RM)^N / R.
 * This means that the input data must be smaller than the maximum cic_t
 * value divided by Gmax. If the following values are given for a decimation
 * filter:
 *
 * R = 5
 * N = 4
 * M = 1
 * cic_t = int32_t
 *
 * Gmax = 625
 * The maximum input value is 2^31 / 625 which is around 3.4e6.
 *
 * For larger rate change factors Gmax can be huge. For interpolation filters
 * the only way is to switch to a larger data type int64_t for example. For
 * decimation filters the integrator stage may be modified in the future.
 * Regarding to the original paper it should be possible to decimate the data
 * within each stage of the integrator.
